Assistive technology (AT) (like screen readers) needs the right HTML semantic elements and/or roles in order to parse the page correctly. This addon helps make it easier for Ember developers by adding the correct role to the HTML element.

## Installation

```bash
ember install ember-a11y-landmarks
```

## Usage
- Use these like blocks.
- Define the `tagName` unless it's a div, then define the `landmarkRole` instead.
- Use the comments in [the component](https://github.com/MelSumner/ember-a11y-landmarks/blob/master/addon/components/a11y-landmark.js) as a guide.

### Template

#### Example: Header
To use as header element, put this in your template:
```hbs
{{#a11y-landmark tagName="header"}}
    ...
{{/a11y-landmark}}
```
The element is then a `<header>` and the `role="banner"` is added automatically.

#### Example: Form/Search
If defining a form, no additional `landmarkRole` is required. However, if the form will be used as a search, then the `landmarkRole` value should be set to `search`.

Form:
```hbs
{{#a11y-landmark tagName="form"}}
    ...
{{/a11y-landmark}}
```

Search:
```hbs
{{#a11y-landmark tagName="form" landmarkRole="search"}}
    ...
{{/a11y-landmark}}
```
